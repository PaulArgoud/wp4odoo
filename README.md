Modular WordPress plugin that creates a seamless, bidirectional bridge between WordPress/WooCommerce and Odoo ERP (v14+). Built on a clean, extensible architecture with 72 integration modules, an async sync queue, WordPress Multisite support (per-site company scoping), and full WP-CLI support. Ships in **3 languages** (English, French, Spanish).

**Target users:** WordPress agencies and businesses running Odoo as their ERP who need reliable, real-time data flow between their website and back-office.

## Features

- **Async Queue** — No API calls during user requests; all sync jobs go through a persistent database queue with exponential backoff, deduplication, and configurable batch size
- **Dual Transport** — JSON-RPC 2.0 (default for Odoo 17+) and XML-RPC (legacy), swappable via settings, shared HTTP layer via `Retryable_Http` trait. Retry orchestration at queue level (exponential backoff via `Sync_Engine`)
- **Encrypted Credentials** — API keys encrypted at rest with libsodium (OpenSSL fallback)
- **Webhooks** — REST API endpoints for real-time notifications from Odoo, with per-IP rate limiting
- **Admin Dashboard** — 6-tab settings interface (Connection, Sync, Modules, Queue, Logs, Health) with guided onboarding and system health monitoring
- **WP-CLI** — Full command suite: `wp wp4odoo status|test|sync|queue|module` for headless management
- **WPML / Polylang Translation Sync** — Multilingual product sync via WPML or Polylang: pushes translated names/descriptions to Odoo with language context, pulls translations back to create/update translated posts. Category and attribute value translations included
- **Multisite** — WordPress Multisite support: each site in a network syncs with a specific Odoo company (`res.company`). Shared network connection with per-site company_id mapping. Network admin page for centralized configuration
- **Extensible** — Register custom modules via `wp4odoo_register_modules`; filter data with `wp4odoo_map_to_odoo_*` / `wp4odoo_map_from_odoo_*`; map ACF or JetEngine custom fields to Odoo via meta-modules
- **Multilingual** — 1006 translatable strings, ships with English, French, and Spanish. Translation-ready via `.po`/`.mo`

## Requirements

PHP 8.2+, MySQL 8.0+ / MariaDB 10.5+, WordPress 6.0+, Odoo 17+ (JSON-RPC) or 14+ (XML-RPC).

### Odoo Compatibility

| Versions | On-Premise | Odoo.sh   | Online  | One App Free |
|:---------|:----------:|:---------:|:-------:|:------------:|
| 17 – 19  | ✅ Full³   | ✅ Full³ | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Partial²  |
| 14 – 16  | ✅ Full³   | ✅ Full³ | N/A¹    | N/A¹         |
| < 14     | ❌         | ❌       | N/A¹    | N/A¹         |

> ¹ Odoo Online always runs the latest stable version (currently 17+), so older versions do not apply.
>
> ² **[One App Free](https://www.odoo.com/pricing)** is Odoo's free plan (one app, unlimited users). WP4Odoo modules require multiple Odoo apps (see table below), so only a subset of features will work. Upgrade to the Standard plan for full compatibility.
>
> ³ Works with both Odoo **Community** (free) and **Enterprise** editions — all required apps are included in Community.

- **Odoo 17+** — uses JSON-RPC 2.0 (default, recommended)
- **Odoo 14 – 16** — uses XML-RPC (legacy transport, select in plugin settings)
- **Odoo < 14** — not supported (external API incompatibilities)

All hosting types expose the standard Odoo external API used by the plugin. No custom Odoo modules are required — only the standard apps listed in the module tables below.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository into `wp-content/plugins/wp4odoo/`
2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin
3. Go to **Odoo Connector** in the admin menu
4. Enter your Odoo credentials (URL, database, username, API key) in the **Connection** tab
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify
6. Enable the modules you need in the **Modules** tab

## Module System

Each Odoo domain is encapsulated in an independent module extending `Module_Base`. The plugin automatically detects missing Odoo apps at connection test and module activation.

**Sync direction:** ↔️ Bidirectional — ➡️ WP to Odoo — ⬅️ Odoo to WP

## Usage

### Shortcodes

| Shortcode                   | Description                                                                                       |

### WP-CLI

```bash
wp wp4odoo status                    # Connection info, queue stats, modules
wp wp4odoo test                      # Test Odoo connection
wp wp4odoo sync run                  # Process sync queue
wp wp4odoo sync run --dry-run        # Preview sync without changes
wp wp4odoo sync run --blog_id=3      # Process queue for a specific site (multisite)
wp wp4odoo queue stats               # Queue statistics
wp wp4odoo queue list --page=1       # Paginated job list
wp wp4odoo queue retry               # Retry all failed jobs

wp wp4odoo cleanup orphans           # Remove orphaned entity map entries
wp wp4odoo cleanup orphans --dry-run # Preview orphans without deleting
wp wp4odoo cache flush               # Flush Odoo schema cache
wp wp4odoo module list               # List modules with status
wp wp4odoo module enable crm         # Enable a module
wp wp4odoo module disable crm        # Disable a module
```

### REST API & Hooks

The plugin exposes 4 REST endpoints under `wp-json/wp4odoo/v1/` (webhook receiver, webhook health check, system health, manual sync trigger) and 14 action hooks + 68 data filters for customization.

## Architecture

![WP4ODOO Architecture](assets/images/architecture-synth.svg)

All synchronization goes through a persistent database queue — no Odoo API calls are made during user requests:

1. A WordPress or Odoo event triggers a sync job
2. The job is enqueued in `wp4odoo_sync_queue`
3. A WP-Cron task processes the queue in configurable batches
4. Data is transformed via `Field_Mapper` and sent through `Odoo_Client`
5. Entity mappings are stored in `wp4odoo_entity_map` with sync hashes for change detection

### Security

- API keys encrypted at rest (libsodium with OpenSSL fallback)
- Admin AJAX handlers protected by nonce + `manage_options` capability
- Webhooks authenticated via `X-Odoo-Token` header + per-IP rate limiting (20 req/min)
- All inputs sanitized (`sanitize_text_field`, `esc_url_raw`, `absint`)
- `index.php` in every subdirectory to prevent directory listing

## Development

```bash
composer install
composer check          # Runs PHPCS + PHPUnit + PHPStan (mirrors CI)
```

Integration tests require Docker.
