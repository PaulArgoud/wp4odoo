## Features

- **Admin Dashboard** — 5-tab settings interface: Connection, Sync, Modules, Queue, Logs
- **Async Queue** — No API calls during user requests; all sync jobs go through a persistent database queue with exponential backoff, deduplication, and configurable batch size

- **Dual Transport** — JSON-RPC 2.0 (default for Odoo 17+) and XML-RPC (legacy), swappable via settings, shared retry logic via `Retryable_Http` trait (3 attempts, exponential backoff + jitter)
- **Encrypted Credentials** — API keys encrypted at rest with libsodium (OpenSSL fallback)
- **Extensible** — Register custom modules via `wp4odoo_register_modules` action hook; filter data with `wp4odoo_map_to_odoo_*` / `wp4odoo_map_from_odoo_*`
- **Multilingual (3 languages)** — Fully internationalized with WordPress standard Gettext i18n. Ships with English (source), French, and Spanish translations (417 strings). Translation-ready for additional languages via `.po`/`.mo` files
- **Onboarding** — Post-activation redirect, setup notice, 3-step checklist with progress bar, inline Odoo documentation (API keys, webhooks)
- **Webhooks** — REST API endpoints for real-time notifications from Odoo, with per-IP rate limiting
- **WP-CLI** — Full command suite: `wp wp4odoo status|test|sync|queue|module` for headless management

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Odoo 17+ (JSON-RPC) or Odoo 14+ (XML-RPC)
- WordPress 6.0+

## Compatibility

### By Odoo version and hosting type

| Versions | On-Premise | Odoo.sh   | Online  | One App Free |
|:---------|:----------:|:---------:|:-------:|:------------:|
| 17 – 19  | ✅ Full³   | ✅ Full³ | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Partial²  |
| 14 – 16  | ✅ Full³   | ✅ Full³ | N/A¹    | N/A¹         |
| < 14     | ❌         | ❌       | N/A¹    | N/A¹         |

> ¹ Odoo Online always runs the latest stable version (currently 17+), so older versions do not apply.
>
> ² **[One App Free](https://www.odoo.com/pricing)** is Odoo's free plan (one app, unlimited users). WP4Odoo modules require multiple Odoo apps (see table below), so only a subset of features will work. Upgrade to the Standard plan for full compatibility.
>
> ³ Works with both Odoo **Community** (free) and **Enterprise** editions — all required apps are included in Community.

- **Odoo 17+** — uses JSON-RPC 2.0 (default, recommended)
- **Odoo 14 – 16** — uses XML-RPC (legacy transport, select in plugin settings)
- **Odoo < 14** — not supported (external API incompatibilities)

All hosting types expose the standard Odoo external API used by the plugin. No custom Odoo modules are required — only the standard apps listed in the [module table](#module-system) below.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository into `wp-content/plugins/wordpress-for-odoo/`
2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin
3. Go to **Odoo Connector** in the admin menu
4. Enter your Odoo credentials (URL, database, username, API key) in the **Connection** tab
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify
6. Enable the modules you need in the **Modules** tab

## Module System

Each Odoo domain is encapsulated in an independent module extending `Module_Base`. The plugin automatically detects missing Odoo apps at connection test and module activation.

> ⁴ **[One App Free](https://www.odoo.com/pricing)**: with CRM as your free app, CRM and Forms modules work. With Invoicing as your free app, GiveWP, WP Charitable, WP Simple Pay, Sprout Invoices, and WP-Invoice work. With Calendar as your free app, Amelia, Bookly, and Events Calendar (fallback mode) work (partial — no Contacts). Sales, WooCommerce, WooCommerce Subscriptions (Enterprise), Memberships (MemberPress/PMPro/RCP/WC Memberships), LMS (LearnDash/LifterLMS), Ecwid, and WP Recipe Maker require 2–4 apps.

### Third-party modules

Third-party modules can be registered:

```php
add_action('wp4odoo_register_modules', function($plugin) {
    $plugin->register_module('my_module', new My_Custom_Module());
});
```

| `wp4odoo_ssl_verify`                      | Enable/disable SSL verification   |

Each module also provides `wp4odoo_{module}_*_status_map` filters for customizing status mappings (e.g., `wp4odoo_mepr_txn_status_map`, `wp4odoo_wcs_status_map`). See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#hooks--filters) for the full list.

## Architecture

![WP4ODOO Architecture](assets/images/architecture-v2.svg)

### Sync Flow

All synchronization goes through a persistent database queue — no Odoo API calls are made during user requests:

1. A WordPress or Odoo event triggers a sync job
2. The job is enqueued in `wp4odoo_sync_queue`
3. A WP-Cron task processes the queue in configurable batches
4. Data is transformed via `Field_Mapper` and sent through `Odoo_Client`
5. Entity mappings are stored in `wp4odoo_entity_map` with sync hashes for change detection

### Security

- API keys encrypted at rest (libsodium with OpenSSL fallback)
- Admin AJAX handlers protected by nonce + `manage_options` capability
- Webhooks authenticated via `X-Odoo-Token` header + per-IP rate limiting (100 req/min)
- All inputs sanitized (`sanitize_text_field`, `esc_url_raw`, `absint`)
- `index.php` in every subdirectory to prevent directory listing

## Development

For detailed architecture, class diagrams, and data flows, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). For version history, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install

composer check

# Or run individually:
composer phpcs                # Coding standards (PHPCS — WordPress-Extra)
composer test                 # Unit tests (PHPUnit)
composer phpstan              # Static analysis (PHPStan level 5)

# Integration tests (requires Docker)
npm install
npx wp-env start
npm run test:integration
npx wp-env stop
```

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
