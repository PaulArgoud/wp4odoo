- WordPress 6.0+

## Compatibility

### By Odoo version and hosting type

| Versions | On-Premise | Odoo.sh   | Online  | One App Free |
|:---------|:----------:|:---------:|:-------:|:------------:|
| 17 – 19  | ✅ Full³   | ✅ Full³ | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Partial²  |
| 14 – 16  | ✅ Full³   | ✅ Full³ | N/A¹    | N/A¹         |
| < 14     | ❌         | ❌       | N/A¹    | N/A¹         |

> ¹ Odoo Online always runs the latest stable version (currently 17+), so older versions do not apply.
>
> ² **[One App Free](https://www.odoo.com/pricing)** is Odoo's free plan (one app, unlimited users). WP4Odoo modules require multiple Odoo apps (see table below), so only a subset of features will work. Upgrade to the Standard plan for full compatibility.
>
> ³ Works with both Odoo **Community** (free) and **Enterprise** editions — all required apps are included in Community.

- **Odoo 17+** — uses JSON-RPC 2.0 (default, recommended)
- **Odoo 14 – 16** — uses XML-RPC (legacy transport, select in plugin settings)
- **Odoo < 14** — not supported (external API incompatibilities)

All hosting types expose the standard Odoo external API used by the plugin. No custom Odoo modules are required — only the standard apps listed in the [module table](#module-system) below.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository into `wp-content/plugins/wordpress-for-odoo/`
2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin
3. Go to **Odoo Connector** in the admin menu
4. Enter your Odoo credentials (URL, database, username, API key) in the **Connection** tab
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify
6. Enable the modules you need in the **Modules** tab

## Module System

Each Odoo domain is encapsulated in an independent module extending `Module_Base`. The plugin automatically detects missing Odoo apps at connection test and module activation.

> ⁴ **[One App Free](https://www.odoo.com/pricing)**: with CRM as your free app, CRM and Forms modules work. With Invoicing as your free app, GiveWP, WP Charitable, and WP Simple Pay work. With Calendar as your free app, Amelia and Bookly work (partial — no Contacts). Sales, WooCommerce, WooCommerce Subscriptions (Enterprise), Memberships (MemberPress/PMPro/RCP/WC Memberships), LMS (LearnDash/LifterLMS), and WP Recipe Maker require 2–4 apps.

## Architecture

![WP4ODOO Architecture](assets/images/architecture-v2.svg)

### Sync Flow

All synchronization goes through a persistent database queue — no Odoo API calls are made during user requests:

1. A WordPress or Odoo event triggers a sync job
2. The job is enqueued in `wp4odoo_sync_queue`
3. A WP-Cron task processes the queue in configurable batches
4. Data is transformed via `Field_Mapper` and sent through `Odoo_Client`
5. Entity mappings are stored in `wp4odoo_entity_map` with sync hashes for change detection

### Security

- API keys encrypted at rest (libsodium with OpenSSL fallback)
- Admin AJAX handlers protected by nonce + `manage_options` capability
- Webhooks authenticated via `X-Odoo-Token` header + per-IP rate limiting (100 req/min)
- All inputs sanitized (`sanitize_text_field`, `esc_url_raw`, `absint`)
- `index.php` in every subdirectory to prevent directory listing
